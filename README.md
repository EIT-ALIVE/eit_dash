# GUI for processing EIT data for EIT-alive project

[mockup](https://github.com/EIT-ALIVE/eitprocessing/files/11480259/Proposal.GUI.mockup.pptx)


### How to run our GUI:

A provisional environment can be built from the environment_lint.yml file. At this point the project is not ready to run data, but we expect it to be on an upcoming release. Please contact the current project maintainer (Dani Bodor ðŸ“« d.bodor@esciencecenter.nl) with questions. 

If you want to build our environment you may be able to use Anaconda, but this environment is a work in process..
This dashboard requires that you have an environment with certain dependencies including dash. We recommend that if you want to build with Anaconda you do the following:

Install all Python packages required, using conda and the
`environment_lint.yml` file. The command for Windows/Anaconda users can be something like:

    conda env create -f environment_lint.yml
    Linux users, or anyone, can create their own environment by hand.
